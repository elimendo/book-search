# Book Search Engine

The Book Search Engine is a dynamic web application that allows users to search for books, view comprehensive details about them, and manage their own collection of saved books. It integrates with the Google Books API to fetch a wide range of books based on the user's search queries. The application also supports user authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their saved books.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** The application offers a seamless login/signup experience through a modal window with toggles between login and signup options.
- **Account Creation:** New users can sign up by providing a username, email address, and password.
